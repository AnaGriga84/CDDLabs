 Task for Lab 6:

 Created a program that has two parts. 
 A producer and a consumer.

 Producer
 The producer generates random characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’. 
 It adds these to a thread safe buffer that has a finite holding capacity of N characters. 
 
 Consumer
 The consumer takes these letters from the buffer and capitalize them.

 The main file demonstrates the producer consumer implementation in 
 action by creating a number of consumers and producers and showing them inaction.
